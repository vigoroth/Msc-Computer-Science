It was nearly midnight, and he was lying on his
stomach in bed, the blankets drawn right over his
head like a tent, a flashlight in one hand and a large
leather-bound book (A History of Magic by Bathilda
Bagshot) propped open against the pillow. Harry
moved the tip of his eagle-feather quill down the page,
frowning as he looked for something that would help
him write his essay, “Witch Burning in the Fourteenth
Century Was Completely Pointless — discuss.”

The quill paused at the top of a likely-looking
paragraph. Harry pushed his round glasses up the
bridge of his nose, moved his flashlight closer to the
book, and read:

For one thing, he hated the summer holidays more
than any other time of year. For another, he really
wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in
secret, in the dead of night. And he also happened to
be a wizard.
